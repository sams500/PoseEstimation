# PoseEstimation
A simple program to detect people's pose. I aim to introduce other tasks on this base program i.e. after detecting the pose it returns a set of landmarks and based on the positio of the land mark, it will perform specific. 

To achive this, I used [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for video capturing, and a free library offered by Google, [Mediapipe](https://mediapipe.dev/).
